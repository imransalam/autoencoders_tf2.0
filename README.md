# autoencoders_tf2.0
Simple, denoising and variational autoencoders made in TensorFlow2.0

The code is very repetitive, for educational and learning perspective.

All experiments are made with MNIST data
I have not added the evaluation scripts in the repository. That is a practice for the readers of
